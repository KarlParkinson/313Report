\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}

A peer-to-peer architecture, or P2P, is the usual alternative to an architecture based on the client-server model. In the client-server model, one or more central machines provide resources and services to client machines. The two different machines, the client and the server, are separate in the sense that the server performs all or most of the computation on behalf of the client. In contrast, within a P2P network all the machines both provide and request computational resources and thus operate both as client and server. All the machines in a peer-to-peer network can therefore be considered equals or ``peers.''

\paragraph{}

This paper seeks to summarize the findings of our research into peer-to-peer networks. It will do so in three parts. First, the major challenges and concepts of P2P networking will be explored; these include network overlays, routing, and resource discovery. Second, some example applications of peer-to-peer computing will be discussed. Finally, our concluding section will summarize peer-to-peer networking and why it is important.
